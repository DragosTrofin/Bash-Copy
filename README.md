MySSH is a project made in my second year of Computer Science Faculty at my computer networks course. I had to remake the SSH, and i took it to a higher level. I made an interactive one, where you can use different commands to create, edit and save files such as nano or vim, by making a pseudoterminal, and a non-interactive one where you can use all the commands except the interactive ones where you could open and edit files. After making this project and finsihing this course I learned a lot about process communication, communication protocols, and I also improved my presenting and project managing skills. I posted some screenshots with a couple of examples
